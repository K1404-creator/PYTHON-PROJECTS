# Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this  code encrypts and decrypts passwords:

# ---

# ### 1. **Encryption (Storing the Password)**

# - When you call `add()`, the user enters an account name and a password.
# - The password is encrypted using this line:
#   ```python
#   fer.encrypt(pwd.encode()).decode()
#   ```
#   - `pwd.encode()` converts the password (a string) into bytes, which is required for encryption.
#   - `fer.encrypt(...)` uses the Fernet object (created with your secret key) to encrypt the bytes. This produces an encrypted byte string (ciphertext).
#   - `.decode()` converts the encrypted bytes back into a string so it can be saved in a text file.
# - The code then writes a line to password.txt:
#   ```
#   account_name|encrypted_password
#   ```
#   For example, if the account is "gmail" and the password is "mypassword", the file might contain:
#   ```
#   gmail|gAAAAABk... (a long string of random-looking characters)
#   ```
#   The encrypted password is unreadable without the key.

# ---

# ### 2. **Decryption (Viewing the Password)**

# - When you call `view()`, the code reads each line from password.txt.
# - It splits each line into `user` (the account name) and `passw` (the encrypted password string).
# - To decrypt, it uses:
#   ```python
#   fer.decrypt(passw.encode()).decode()
#   ```
#   - `passw.encode()` turns the encrypted string back into bytes.
#   - `fer.decrypt(...)` uses the Fernet object (with your secret key) to decrypt the bytes, turning them back into the original password bytes.
#   - `.decode()` converts the bytes back into a readable string (the original password).
# - The code then prints the account name and the decrypted password.

# ---

# ### 3. **Why is this secure?**

# - The password is never stored in plain text. Only the encrypted version is saved.
# - Without the correct key (from key.key), the encrypted password cannot be decrypted.
# - Even if someone opens password.txt, they cannot see your real passwords.

# ---

# **Summary:**  
# - **Encryption:** Converts your password into unreadable text using your secret key before saving.
# - **Decryption:** Converts the unreadable text back into your real password using the same key when you want to view it.
